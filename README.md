# HaraDB
> A Haraka plugin written in Javascript for logging outbound e-mail traffic to a PostgreSQL database.

Haraka has no built in logging functionality for an outbound e-mail server, so this plugin was created to easily record all outbound e-mail data into a PostgreSQL database. This can easily be updated to any other type of SQL database, and the specific data uploaded from each e-mail can also be changed easily through a configuration file.  

## Requirements
You must have an outbound Haraka server already setup for this to work. I reccomend following this tutorial for that: 
> [Creating an E-Mail Service with Haraka](https://thihara.github.io/Creating-E-Mail-Service-with-Haraka/) 
 
After you have that set up, HaraDB only requires 2 extra node.js packages:

> npm install dateformat  

> npm install pg

The first is for easy date formatting, the second is the PostgreSQL integration package.

## Release History
* 1.2
    * Fixed email_id sequence skipping numbers when an e-mail gets sent to more than one address
    * Added compare query instead of using conflicts for above
